Command line for the win

When I tried to use the SFTP credentials on my computer, they failed; this was the message that I got ['sftp' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch].
I had to find another way; these are the steps I took:

0. I downloaded the 'Termius' app to work as my local computer.
1. Followed the instructions on the app.
2. The app is GUI based so it was easier than using a computer.
3. The user navigates to the SFTP option.
4. Then to the directory where you want to transfer the files to.
5. Before all that I had already completed the command challenge on the computer and 
   transferred the screenshots to my phone's memory.
6. Then I copied the files to the directory as instructed on the app.
7. When I checked my directory on the sandbox, the files were there.
8. SUCCESS.
